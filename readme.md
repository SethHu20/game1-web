# Game1 Web port

Web port of Android Platform Mini game "game1" by cros107.

## Development

Clone this repository and run `npm install`

Build the project through webpack using `npm run build`, or enable watch mode while developing with `npm run watch`, and start local server using `npm start`.

## Workflow

I considered adapting to more tech / tools / workflow as the project develops, intended to make life easier as the project grows, and encourage more collaboration.

- Test cases
  - Pipelines, CI, whatever
- Typescript
- Something other than CSS

## Questions

- Why is repo called Greedy Barber?

*Performance reasons.*

- Three.js is a rendering library, maybe Babylon is an actual game engine?

But I want to code a crappy game engine and claim to be one of those people who code their own game engine.
